Introduction
------------
``OSNAP`` is a way to deliver self-contained Python applications to end users for Windows and OSX/MacOS.  
This process is known as freezing and installing.  Examples include delivering Python applications to Windows 
PCs (both laptops and desktops), MacBooks, and iMacs.

Now on PyPI:
``pip install osnap``
